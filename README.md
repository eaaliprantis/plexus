## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/eaaliprantis/plexus.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.
